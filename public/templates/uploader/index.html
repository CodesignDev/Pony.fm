<div class="uploader">
    <div class="dropzone" uploader>
        <p>Drop files here to begin your upload!</p>
    </div>

    <p>Our preferred formats are FLAC, WAV, AIFF, and ALAC (because lossless audio is awesome) but we accept a few others, too. Each file can be up to 200 MB in size.</p>

    <p>Tracks must be a <strong>minimum</strong> of 30 seconds long.</p>

    <p>Note that you&#39;ll need to publish your tracks after uploading them before they&#39;ll become available to the public.</p>

    <p>Contact <a href="mailto:feld0@pony.fm">feld0@pony.fm</a> if you run into any issues!</p>
